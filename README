A Month Picker for [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/)
================================

Why using it?
---

You may be already using [JQuery UI Datepicker](http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/) and are now looking for a Monthpicker. Unfortunately, this is not part of the functionalities of JQuery UI Datepicker.
After some Googling, you will realize two things: you are not alone having a need for a Monthpicker, and most solutions only are relying on dirty hacks on the original JQuery UI Datepicker widget.

Be relieved, you have now found dedicated working and customizable Monthpicker implementation. In the background, it is largely based on JQuery UI Datepicker, which is why it is working so great and looking so nice!
You will notice that the design is very similar to JQuery UI Datepicker, as it uses the same CSS. Hence it is fully compatible with your usual JQuery UI theme!

Alternatives

[Luciano Costa](https://github.com/lucianocosta/jquery.mtz.monthpicker) has developed his own implementation from scratch of a Monthpicker.
It is far better than most JQuery UI Datepicker hacks you will find on the internet but it has some severe limitations: it has very limited settings, settings are shared by all instances on the same page...
